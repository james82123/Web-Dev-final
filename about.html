<h2>My name is Yi-Cheng, but call me James.</h2>

    
<p>I was born into this world kicking and screaming, like a clump of silly puddy pushed through a funnel then what remained rolled down the side of a hill and into oncoming traffic.
Without much to cling to other than the knowledge that if I keep breathing I just might stay alive in this world, I wandered through life without direction -- an aimless trail that
winded and twisted with no apparent goal other than to frustrate the hell out of you.
</p>
    
<h3>So what to do..</h3>

<p>Breathing is easy. About as easy as it gets. But to be human requires one to put oneself out there, into the open, where your scars and nitty gritty details reveal themselves for
    the world to see. The hope is by the end of it, someone as broken or depraved as you comes along and accepts you for what you are.
</p>

<p>I never really stepped out into the open. And I can no longer recall whether it was by choice or by the judging eyes of my peers. Memories are fickle like that and it's hard to tell
    whether or not you remembered everything correctly. Was Richard really being an asshole to me the entirety of seventh grade? Or was I just a stick in the mud who didn't understand
    social cues? Regardless, what I do remember is staying within myself for long
    hours at a time dreaming about worlds that did not exist and conversations that could not exist. Perhaps this was a way of extending my social legs in order to interact with some form
    of community, however obscured these communities are.
</p>

<h3>And now?</h3>

<p>Coming into terms with the inevitable finiteness of life is easy. Everyone knows they'll eventually croak. It's making something of what you're given, making it all count for something in the end -- that's the hard part. I had invited myself into the world
    of higher education in order to make something of my hands, while I still have them.
